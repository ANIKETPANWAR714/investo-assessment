## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React - JS library
- Next.js - React framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills with React and Next.js, especially in implementing dynamic features like dark mode toggling. Hereâ€™s an example of how I applied dark mode toggle functionality:

```js
const toggleDarkMode = () => {
  setDarkMode(prevMode => !prevMode);
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (darkMode) {
    document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
  } else {
    document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
  }
}, [darkMode]);
